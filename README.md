Design of SDR communication for wildlife tracking using WSN

In this project, I designed a low-cost and flexible software-defined radio based
sensing and communication system for wildlife tracking. The regular communication system in this
field performs in the ISM band, which is highly affected by high interference and lack of security.
However, the proposed design had a reasonably wide frequency range and could provide the
desired flexibility in dynamic network conditions using SDR communication.
